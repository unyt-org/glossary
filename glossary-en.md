# Technology
## JSX (JavaScript XML)
**JSX** JSX is a syntax extension for JavaScript used in React frameworks, allowing developers to write HTML-like code within JavaScript for defining and structuring user interface components efficiently. It gets transpiled into regular JavaScript for browser compatibility.

## SCSS (Sass Cascading Style Sheets)
**SCSS** is a CSS preprocessor that adds powerful features like variables, nesting, and mixins to standard CSS, making styling more organized and efficient in web development projects. It compiles into regular CSS for browser interpretation.

## CSS (Cascading Style Sheets)
**CSS** is a language used in web development to control the visual presentation and layout of HTML elements, enabling the design and styling of web pages for improved user experiences.

## HTML (Hypertext Markup Language)
**HTML** is the standard language for creating and structuring web content, using tags to define the elements and their relationships, forming the foundation of web pages and applications.

## JavaScript
**JavaScript** is a versatile programming language widely used for adding interactivity, dynamic behavior, and logic to web pages and applications, making them responsive and engaging for users. It runs in web browsers and can also be used on server-side environments.

## TypeScript
**TypeScript** is a superset of JavaScript that adds static typing and advanced tooling, aiding in the development of more robust and maintainable web applications by catching errors and providing better code organization during development. It compiles to plain JavaScript for browser execution.


# HELIX
HELIX is [unyt.org](https://unyt.org)'s blockchain solution that serves security on the Supranet. Using the latest cryptographic technologies, data authenticity, security and privacy can be combined. HELIX acts as a transparent anonymous and decentralized shared storage.

# UIX
## UIX
**UIX** is [unyt.org](https://unyt.org)'s full-stack web framework for the next generation of web development. UIX combines advanced technologies and allows developers to merge distributed application on the Supranet.

## Front-end
**Front-end** development involves creating the logical, visual and interactive aspects of a UIX application that users directly interact with, to ensure a user-friendly and engaging interface.

## Back-end
**Back-end** development involves building the behind-the-scenes components of a UIX application, including server logic, databases, and iterfaces, responsible for processing data and powering the interactions between the front-end and various services.

## SSR (Server-side rendering)
With **server-side rendering**, applications (websites) are not rendered in the browser, but are created and rendered on the server. This allows for speed and performance gains.

## Hydration
**Hydration** is the practice of adding interactivity to a pre-rendered web page by injecting JavaScript. This enables the page to update and respond to user actions without a full reload. Hydration combines SSR's initial speed with client-side rendering's dynamic user experience, enhancing web app performance and usability.

## DOM (Document Object Model)
The **DOM** is a programming interface for web documents, representing the structured elements of an HTML document as a tree of objects. It enables dynamic manipulation and interaction with web page content through JavaScript.

## Shadow DOM (Shadow Document Object Model)
The **Shadow DOM** is a web standard that encapsulates elements and their styles within a scoped boundary, allowing developers to create isolated and reusable components with encapsulated styling and behavior. It's particularly useful for building web components that don't interfere with the rest of the page's styling or JavaScript.

## Web Components
**Web Components** are a set of web platform features that enable the creation of reusable, encapsulated, and customizable HTML elements with their own styles and behaviors, promoting modular and maintainable web development. They consist of Custom Elements, Shadow DOM, and HTML Templates.

## Reactivity
**Reactivity** refers to the ability of UI to automatically update in response to changes in underlying data, ensuring real-time synchronization and a dynamic user experience. It's a crucial concept in UIX for building interactive and responsive applications.

## UI (User Interface)
**UI** refers to the visual and interactive elements of UIX application that users interact with, encompassing layouts like buttons, forms, and other components designed for seamless user experiences and effective communication of information.

## Full-stack
**Full-tack** web development involves working on both the front-end (UI) and back-end (server) of a web application, allowing developers to create end-to-end solutions that encompass all layers of technology required for a functional application.

# Crypto
## RSA (Rivest-Shamir-Adleman)
**RSA** is a widely used asymmetric encryption algorithm that uses a pair of keys (public and private) for secure data transmission and digital signatures. It's named after its inventors and is based on the mathematical difficulty of factoring large composite numbers.

## AES (Advanced Encryption Standard)
**AES** is a widely used symmetric encryption algorithm, chosen for its security and efficiency, employed in various applications to secure sensitive data by converting it into an unreadable format using a secret encryption key.

# DATEX
## DATEX
**DATEX** is [unyt.org](https://unyt.org)'s full-stack communication protocol that enables the exchange and synchronization of real-time data on the Supranet.

## Endpoint
**Endpoints** are consumer devices and users that are connected to the Supranet in order to communicate with each other. Endpoints can be individuals, organizations, IoT devices and bots, or applications.

## Supranet
The **Supranet** is [unyt.org](https://unyt.org)'s innovative decentralized peer-to-peer network that empowers individuals to engage in secure, discreet conversations and closes the gap betweem systems. The DATEX protocol serves as the backbone for the Supranet.
